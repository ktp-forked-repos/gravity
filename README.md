# Gravity

Gravity is a Java application that uses RK4 integration to approximate the
movements of n bodies in a 2-dimensional gravitational system. Collisions cause
bodies to merge and conserve momentum.

## Usage

Run `javac gravity/*.java` to compile Gravity, then `java gravity.Gravity` to run it. Use space to pause, d to toggle drawing,
and r to reset the simulation.
